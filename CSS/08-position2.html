      Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in
      laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an
      unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled
      parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen
      book. It usually begins with
    </p>
    <p id="relative-1">
      The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
      (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A
      practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler
      text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not
      content.
    </p>
    <p id="relative-2">
      The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when
      Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as
      desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen
      all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our

      lorem ipsum.

      The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
      consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth,
      centuries ago, it was Latin.
